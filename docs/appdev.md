# Hienob Application File Development
The application file type is .haf and it should be html. and how can you build/pack it? just make a .zip file and put files in it. like this :
- ```.HAF
  my_app.haf:
  - index.html ( the application homepage or startup html )
  - icon.png ( the image that shows on the apps list list )
  - **other files**
  ```
So basic and easy. if you want it to get published in store please consider sending the .haf to bargmygames@gmail.com or just send it as a file in [Issues](https://github.com/bargmy/HienoBOS/issues) with the description and the name of it
