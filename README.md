# HienoBOS
a simple OS ( or what ever you call it ) based on HTML-5 made with Construct 2
able to run html games or programs on it
- **Console Version** : You can navigate and use it using a Controller and have UI look like an console
- **Desktop Version** : Comming Soon
- **Mobile Version** : Comming Soon

~~my idea is running this thing on a raspberryPI but its not possible for me to do it because i dont have enough money to buy an raspberryPI
so if you have an raspberryPI try running it if you want and i'll be sure that this thing will work or not~~
thanks to penguin-eggs now i made the Console version available but it has so many bugs in the system side and not UI side.
installation is not available. if you wondered why i didnt put the source code its because its already available in the system files of the os and the services are python codes and html codes.
